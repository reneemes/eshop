It demonstrates skills in front-end development, responsive design, form validation, and deployment.

<!-- ### Key Features & Assessment Criteria

  * Consistent use of classes, IDs, and CSS selectors enhances maintainability.

* Responsive Design & Media Queries
  * Media queries ensure that the site adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
  * Layout, images, and typography scale appropriately to different screen sizes.
